## 🎯 Business Challenges
- Multiple branches with inconsistent VPN setups and policies.  
- Inefficient bandwidth usage with frequent WAN performance issues.  
- Limited failover capabilities in case of link outages.  
- Lack of unified, centralized policy enforcement across offices.

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented
We designed and deployed a **FortiGate-based SD-WAN solution** with dynamic routing to ensure secure and optimized branch connectivity:  
- **FortiGate firewalls** deployed at all branches.  
- **SD-WAN overlay** for intelligent path selection and link optimization.  
- **BGP dynamic routing** for seamless failover and performance improvement.  
- Standardized **VPN tunnels** and security policies across sites.  
- Centralized management for unified monitoring and reporting.
