## Project Overview
As Lead Engineer, I delivered a **secure multi-branch network deployment** for **LCB Finance PLC**, a financial institution with multiple branch locations across Sri Lanka.  

The project centered on **FortiGate SD-WAN**, enabling secure, optimized, and resilient WAN connectivity with centralized management and standardized security policies.  

---

## Business Challenges
- Multiple branches with inconsistent VPN setups and policies.  
- Inefficient bandwidth usage with frequent WAN performance issues.  
- Limited failover capabilities in case of link outages.  
- Lack of unified, centralized policy enforcement across offices.  

---

## Solution Implemented
We designed and deployed a **FortiGate-based SD-WAN solution** with dynamic routing to ensure secure and optimized branch connectivity:  
- **FortiGate firewalls** deployed at all branches.  
- **SD-WAN overlay** for intelligent path selection and link optimization.  
- **BGP dynamic routing** for seamless failover and performance improvement.  
- Standardized **VPN tunnels** and security policies across sites.  
- Centralized management for unified monitoring and reporting.  

---

## Outcomes & Benefits
- **Standardized security policies** across all branch offices.  
- **Resilient SD-WAN connectivity** with automatic failover.  
- **Optimized WAN performance** via intelligent path selection.  
- **Dynamic BGP routing** for seamless scalability and flexibility.  
- **Improved visibility** into branch-to-branch and branch-to-HQ traffic.  

---

## My Key Contributions
- Designed the **SD-WAN architecture** with branch-to-HQ and branch-to-branch resilience.  
- Configured **BGP routing** for optimized failover and redundancy.  
- Implemented **centralized VPN policies** for remote offices.  
- Led deployment and **cutover execution** across multiple branches.  
- Conducted **validation testing** for failover and performance optimization.
